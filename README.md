## Features

- Calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer.
- Uses a loop for computation.
- Simple and easy to understand.

## Installation

To run this program, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone this repository or download the code file.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the code is located.

## Usage

1. Run the program using Python:

   ```bash
   python factorial_calculator.py
When prompted, enter a non-negative integer.
The program will display the factorial of the entered number.
Input Validation
The current implementation does not include input validation. It is recommended to enter a non-negative integer. If a negative number or a non-integer value is entered, the program will raise an error.

Example
Run
Copy code
Enter a number: 5
Factorial of 5 is: 120
Run
Copy code
Enter a number: 0
Factorial of 0 is: 1

# TASK-2

# Mathematical Operations Calculator

This is a simple Python program that performs basic mathematical operations using the `math` module. The program prompts the user to enter a number and then calculates the square root, natural logarithm, and sine of that number.

## Features

- Calculates the square root of a number.
- Computes the natural logarithm (base e) of a number.
- Calculates the sine of a number (in radians).
- Simple and easy to understand.

## Installation

To run this program, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone this repository or download the code file.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the code is located.

## Usage

1. Run the program using Python:

   ```bash
   python math_calculator.py
When prompted, enter a number.
The program will display the square root, natural logarithm, and sine of the entered number.
Input Validation
The current implementation does not include input validation. It is recommended to enter a positive number for the square root and logarithm calculations, as these operations are not defined for negative numbers. The sine function can accept any real number.

Example
Run
Copy code
Enter a number: 4
Square root : 2.0
Logarithm : 1.3862943611198906
Sine : -0.7568024953079282
Run
Copy code
Enter a number: -1
Note: The program will raise a ValueError for the logarithm of a negative number.
